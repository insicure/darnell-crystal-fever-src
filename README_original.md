the almost complete darnell source code, it doesnt include the assets though.

<h1>all my sins when making this game:</h1>

using modified palib but thats def palib<br>
using ram instead of nitrofs for sprites<br>
using floating point numbers instead of fixed point math<br>
bad way to detect collision on X (look at ultra16 or newer b90sr versions for a better way to do it)<br>
darnell's sprite is 16x32 and it's scaled up, thats why the sprite animation is so fucking bad<br>
forced object ids????<br>
not using the same gfx for multiple sprites in some objects<br>
unused object spring collision? <br>
all objects are heavy as fuck on cpu <br>
too many object variations and some of them doing the same FUCKING THING <br>
too many object variations instead of object switches/manipulation<br>
"return" on multiple void functions???<br>
hardcoded object positions <br>
bad stack usage by executing level functions inside of level functions<br>
bad memory usage by using mdPAlib's default nitroFS loading<br>
unnecessary files and text under the nitroFS<br>
bad quality audio (look at the dsgm discord server for high quality music since thats the only good thing about this game) <br>
incompatibility with normal PAlib<br>
god awful final boss<br>
god awful 4 final levels<br>
god awful terrible level design<br>
fundamentally flawed game idea<br>
fundamentally flawed game concept<br>
fundamentally flawed engine oh thats fun<br>
hardcoding the levels was a mistake<br>
doing this while being depressed and this being the only thing i cared about<br>
having a massive ego while creating the stupid fucking thing<br>
<strong>not giving the assets on this repository</strong><br><br>
the game is a 1/10 in game programming, its a 2/10 in fun factor, its a good soundtrack, 
and like a 9/10 in palib gaming theres a better game but this is like one of the best palib games, this is sadly how low the bar is.
